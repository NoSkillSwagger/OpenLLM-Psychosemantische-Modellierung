You will perform a free word association task, similar to the Small World of Words (SWOW) study.

Task:
I will give you a cue word. Your job is to produce up to three associations:
1. Your strongest association (A1)
2. Your second association (A2)
3. Your third association (A3)

Guidelines:
- Each answer must be exactly one single word.
- If you cannot generate a second or third association, you must respond with the placeholder: No more responses
- Do not explain your choices.
- Do not repeat the cue word.
- Each association must be semantically meaningful and distinct.
- No punctuation, no numbering.

Output format (strict):
[cue]; [answer1]; [answer2]; [answer3];

Example:
If the cue is "dog", a valid reply is:
dog; bark; pet; leash;

If you only have one valid association, a valid reply is:
dog; bark; No more responses; No more responses;

Now process the following cue word:
[cue]
